### Dynamic Paragraph
Our data showed that the country with the highest emission per capita was `r summary_info$highest_emissions_per_capita`.


## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Chart 1: 
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```


### Chart 2: Greenhouse Gas Emissions per Region (Globally)
```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

### Chart 3: Total C02 Emissions vs. Per Capita by Country
```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
