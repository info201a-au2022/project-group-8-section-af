## Dynamic Paragraph
Our team gathered three data sets in order to gain a better understanding of ESG concerns and how environmental standards and issues differ around the world.
We gathered data and calculate values to answer questions about ESG scores by industry, renewable energy greenhouse gases 
in different regions, and CO2 emissions from countries around the world. We found that the sector (industry) with the highest environmental ESG score
was `r summary_info$subsector_highest_environ_esg`. This is important information for other industries to have access to when looking for how to improve
their own ESG scores in terms of the environment. We also found that the highest share of renewable energy of total energy consumption 
was `r summary_info$highest_renewable_energy_share`%. The country corresponding with this high share of renewable energy is the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In contrast to renewable energy sources, the country with the highest CO2 emissions as of 2018 was `r summary_info$highest_emissions_2018`. 
It is also important to look at countries with high CO2 emissions in terms of population. Our data showed that the country with the highest 
emission per capita was `r summary_info$highest_emissions_per_capita`. This means that this country produces more emissions per person 
than any other country in our data. 



### Aggregated Table

## Chart 3: Total C02 Emissions vs. Per Capita by Country

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
