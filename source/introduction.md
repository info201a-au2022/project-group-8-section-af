### **Introduction:** 

Our project largely revolves around analyzing the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria and how closely large companies on a global scale follow set standards. The criteria set in place is typically used for investors to have a better grasp when making decisions regarding potential investment, as the ESG is a large indicator on how socially conscious a company chooses to be. We take a look at how companies either lower or increase their carbon footprint, and how meticulously these institutions take action to be either a steward or destroyer of nature. However, there are other factors at play. We also focus on the relationships between company and consumer, and how thoughtful said company is about operating within their own communities. This plays hand in hand with looking at the company's leadership, and how these internal controls impact those surrounding them. Overall, a true test of how one interacts with the world with mindfulness.

### **Problem Domain:** 

Our research topic falls within the domain of environmental, social, and corporate concerns. These concerns can be embodied into a sustainability rating system known as ESG in the business world. We can use ESG ratings as well as their individual breakdowns to understand how well a company interacts with the environment as a measure of its own sustainability. According to researchers from Korea University, "with the rapid pace of globalization, every single individualis chasing the technology while ignoring environmental changes accelerated as a consequence" (2021). For our project, we will want to pay special attention to the "E" of ESG, which pertains to environmental risks. According to S&P Global, "the environmental portion of ESG considers how that company performs as a steward of natural or physical environment" (2019). The risks/factors that these corporations are attempting to manage include greenhouse gas emissions, water use, waste and pollution, and land use and biodiversity (2019). Companies have begun to realize that their own economic success could be severely damaged if they do not do their part to protect the environment. They also are being held to higher and higher standards by governments and are incorporating social responsibility initiatives to appeal to consumers. Ultimately, ESG is a “quantifiable measure of sustainability” (techtarget.com, 2022) that can serve as a way to hold corporations accountable for the impacts they have on our natural world, as well as protect people who could suffer from consumerism and capitalism left unchecked.

### **Research Questions:**

**1. For the given industry sectors, what is the country-wide distribution of overall ESG scores?**

This question is vital in relation to our problem domain because it is important to recognize which industries have the best and worst range of sustainability practices, as highlighted by their overall ESG scores and consider how these sectors compare across varying countries worldwide. By taking into account the industry sector but also the sub sector allows for a more deep understanding into how society’s different pillars such as healthcare, telecommunication, and retail among others function differently in terms of consideration into environmental, social and governance affairs within their country. Data trends and reasonings as to why some sectors have better average ESG scores than others as dependent on country can also be derived from a detailed analysis of the chosen data. We want to see how industries measure up against one another and utilize their ESG scores to observe the outcomes of sustainable development on the basis of geographic location. 

**2. For regions in developing areas, how does this affect their renewable energy shares in comparison to other countries in the world?**

This question is important to note as versions of sustainability vary from region to region. Taking into consideration the difference between areas subject to factors of developing are of the utmost importance as these factors ultimately contribute to a country’s renewable energy share. This largely connects to our problem domain as we seek to differentiate between countries who are able to become sustainable through the resources that they have (being more developed) and areas who are simply trying to survive. Every area is simply different, and through investigation, we can further look into what trends can be seen throughout the last couple decades.

**3. What country has the highest emissions total and per capita and how can these measures be used to measure a country’s sustainability practices?**

This question is important because it is important to know what countries are responsible for using practices that are harmful to the environment, and how they compare to countries with less carbon emissions. By looking at both emissions and emissions per capita, we can tell how a country produces CO2 emissions while considering the size of that country. We want to see if countries produce more emissions given the size of the country compared to others, and what can be done to limit CO2 emissions in these countries.


### **Dataset Information:**

The following report has been generated by compiling three complimentary datasets all hosted on Kaggle. Our first dataset provided sustainibility data made up of 15560 entries of unique company names, industry sector values and ESG scores and ratings of both overall (average) and individual breakdowns between Environmental, Social and Governance. The dataset was curated by Kaggle user QPM from France, who had updated data as of March 2022. Our second dataset has 259 unique values and 10 columns which presents the aggregation and manipulation of many ONU UNSDG indexes that assess the sustainability of a country’s development. This set specifically is set to update annually, meaning that we would be able to see the evolution of the progress or detriment over a large period of time. Vittorio Giatti collected the data in order to see the correlation between indexes and countries; and how these factors evolutionizing over time creates a long-term impact. Our third and final dataset highlights global environmental indicators data within which we chose to take a look at the file called CO2 Emissions which has 191 rows and 35 columns. This dataset is related to our problem domain as it demonstrates how ESG efforts differ among countries. Countries with higher CO2 emissions must be held accountable for the harm they cause our environment and so this data is especially important when considering how much emissions countries produce depending on the size of its population. Ruchi Bhatia collected this data because of the importance of environmental indicators for monitoring the state of our environment.

Each visualization in this interactive report is created using the aforementioned datasets, respectively.

### **Key Findings:**

1. The United States is consistently shown to have the highest ESG scores even among a diverse range of industry sectors.
2. A trend of developing countries having less renewable energy shares in their total energy consumption due to external factors.
3. Larger and more developed countries are most responsible for the production of harmful emissions.
