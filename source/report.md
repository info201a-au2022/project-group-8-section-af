### **Abstract:** 
Our main question is to uncover the link between sustainability standards and company operations indifferent countries. To address the question, we will explore three datasets -- the first about Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria of several companies across industry sectors and locations, another about the United Nations' index on countries' sustainability development and finally one on environmental governance factors and location-based adherence to sustianability agreements and polices. We are concerned with ESG indicators because of how they standardize businessess' metrics for social and ethical consciousness. 

### **Keywords:** 
environment, sustainability, social responsibility, corporations, governance

### **Introduction:** 

Our project largely revolves around analyzing the ESG criteria and how closely large companies on a global scale follow set standards. The criteria set in place is typically used for investors to have a better grasp when making decisions regarding potential investment, as the ESG is a large indicator on how socially conscious a company chooses to be. We take a look at how companies either lower or increase their carbon footprint, and how meticulously these institutions take action to be either a steward or destroyer of nature. However, there are other factors at play. We also focus on the relationships between company and consumer, and how thoughtful said company is about operating within their own communities. This plays hand in hand with looking at the company's leadership, and how these internal controls impact those surrounding them. Overall, a true test of how one interacts with the world with mindfulness.

### **Problem Domain:** 

Our research topic falls within the domain of environmental, social, and corporate concerns. These concerns can be embodied into a sustainability rating system known as ESG in the business world. We can use ESG ratings as well as their individual breakdowns to understand how well a company interacts with the environment as a measure of its own sustainability. According to researchers from Korea University, "with the rapid pace of globalization, every single individualis chasing the technology while ignoring environmental changes accelerated as a consequence" (2021). For our project, we will want to pay special attention to the "E" of ESG, which pertains to environmental risks. According to S&P Global, "the environmental portion of ESG considers how that company performs as a steward of natural or physical environment" (2019). The risks/factors that these corporations are attempting to manage include greenhouse gas emissions, water use, waste and pollution, and land use and biodiversity (2019). Companies have begun to realize that their own economic success could be severely damaged if they do not do their part to protect the environment. They also are being held to higher and higher standards by governments and are incorporating social responsibility initiatives to appeal to consumers. Ultimately, ESG is a “quantifiable measure of sustainability” (techtarget.com, 2022) that can serve as a way to hold corporations accountable for the impacts they have on our natural world, as well as protect people who could suffer from consumerism and capitalism left unchecked.

### **Research Questions:**

**1. For the given industry sectors, what is the country-wide distribution of overall ESG scores?**

This question is vital in relation to our problem domain because it is important to recognize which industries have the best and worst range of sustainability practices, as highlighted by their overall ESG scores and consider how these sectors compare across varying countries worldwide. By taking into account the industry sector but also the sub sector allows for a more deep understanding into how society’s different pillars such as healthcare, telecommunication, and retail among others function differently in terms of consideration into environmental, social and governance affairs within their country. Data trends and reasonings as to why some sectors have better average ESG scores than others as dependent on country can also be derived from a detailed analysis of the chosen data. We want to see how industries measure up against one another and utilize their ESG scores to observe the outcomes of sustainable development on the basis of geographic location. 

**2. For regions in developing areas, how does this affect their renewable energy shares in comparison to other countries in the world?**

This question is important to note as versions of sustainability vary from region to region. Taking into consideration the difference between areas subject to factors of developing are of the utmost importance as these factors ultimately contribute to a country’s renewable energy share. This largely connects to our problem domain as we seek to differentiate between countries who are able to become sustainable through the resources that they have (being more developed) and areas who are simply trying to survive. Every area is simply different, and through investigation, we can further look into what trends can be seen throughout the last couple decades.

**3. What country has the highest emissions total and per capita and how can these measures be used to measure a country’s sustainability practices?**

This question is important because it is important to know what countries are responsible for using practices that are harmful to the environment, and how they compare to countries with less carbon emissions. By looking at both emissions and emissions per capita, we can tell how a country produces CO2 emissions while considering the size of that country. We want to see if countries produce more emissions given the size of the country compared to others, and what can be done to limit CO2 emissions in these countries.


### **The Dataset:**


**Kaggle - Sustainability Data**
This given dataset is related to our problem domain since a combination of environmental criteria, social criteria and governance policies are all factors which play into the functioning of a company’s day-to-day performance. Moreover, the aspect of taking into account these standardized ratings allows us to consider the factors that investing companies or individuals utilize to make socially responsible choices with regard to the given company at hand. The dataset is in close collaboration with the above-mentioned research questions rooted in focus on location and industry sector that ESG ratings affect, while also allowing us to consider the rate at which urban development of sustainability occurs among developed versus developing countries. This dataset serves as a filter to ensure that a diverse and vast set of company names, over 15,000 corporations in count, are used when deriving conclusions to our guiding research questions.

The dataset deals with a csv file titled Sustainability Scores in relation to setting a standard for prominent companies across an array of industry sectors. It has 15560 rows of unique values and 10 columns made up of: Company Name, Ticker, Country, Sector, Subsector, Overall ESG Rating, Overall ESG Score, Environmental Score, Social Score, and Governance Score.

*Dataset has since been taken down by Kaggle user, please refer to ‘sustanability_scores.csv’   within the data folder in project-group-8-section-af‘s github repository.*

Kaggle user QPM from France, was the one who collected the data updated as of March 2022. The purpose of this collected data was because of the utmost importance placed upon social consciousness culture in today’s age of envisioning a sustainable future. Investors of large corporations are to benefit the most from this data since it will aid them in ensuring that the companies they invest in are abiding by ESG ratings and scores. Moreover, consumers of the said companies are most likely to also benefit from this information given that it may sway their purchasing decisions as a result. The data is validated and held source by utilizing the standardized ESG score metric to match the public corporations to. This data was obtained from ‘Kaggle’, the reference and url link is below and the author/publisher of this dataset is also cited appropriately.


**Kaggle - ONU Sustainability of Countries**
Our dataset is related to our problem domain as larger companies tend to operate in countries that are currently in the process of developing. This data set directly analyzes the aggregation and manipulation of many ONU UNSDG indexes that assess the sustainability of a country’s development. This set specifically is set to update annually, meaning that we would be able to see the evolution of the progress/detriment over a large quantity of time. This would enable us to answer our question as there are several variables at play that the answer is more gray than black and white; in turn, these scores would allow us to gauge the impact between sustainability and development. This includes but is not limited to; foreign direct investment (support coming in from out of the country); population with primary reliance on clean fuels; total revenues coming from government on total GDP; etc. The varying factors allow us to grasp the bigger picture at hand rather than being stuck within our own perspective.

The current data set appears within 10 columns: year, year in date format, country name, country ONU region, country ONU level of development, total greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) per year, total revenues coming from government on total GDP, foreign direct investment (FDI) to support sustainable development for developing countries, annual growth rate of real GDP per capita (a positive percentage change in real GDP per capita can be interpreted), proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology is calculated as the number of people.

Vittorio Giatti collected the data in order to see the correlation between indexes and countries; and how these factors evolutionizing over time creates a long-term impact. Through the user calculating a custom overall sustainability score, it would be helpful to compare these to bigger companies in already developed countries. By doing so would allow for deeper introspection in how other areas of the world have adapted and why their scores may be different. Are their scores better or worse? Why? What differences create these answers? The data collected here was through the manipulation of datasets from the ONU data portal source. Through thorough investigation, it appears that the institutions that are to profit from collecting said data are actually the bigger companies. We say this as it may benefit them to have other areas of the world negatively compare to them, as this boosts their image and what they are doing to be ‘better.’ The data is reliable and secure as the data was collected through the United Nations; as they are held to a high standard on a global scale. I obtained the data through ‘Kaggle’ and have rightfully cited the individuals who contributed to the cause.


**Kaggle - Global Environmental Indicators Data**
This dataset is related to our problem domain as it demonstrates how ESG efforts differ among countries. Countries with higher CO2 emissions must be held accountable for the harm they cause our environment. This data set lists the countries joined by the United Nations and their CO2 emissions since 1990.. This will be especially important when answering our research questions that concern countries and how much emissions they produce given the size of its population. We can use data about which country produces higher emissions because these countries can be used for other governments to avoid similar practices while also holding these countries accountable and having higher standards for sustainability.

The file we will look at in particular is called CO2 Emissions. It has 191 rows and 35 columns. These columns include: CountryID, Country, Time Series, years 1990 -2018, CO2 Emissions in latest year, Change since 1990, CO2 Emissions per capita in latest year..

Bhatia, Ruchi. 'Global Environmental Indicatiors', Google LLC, Kaggle, 2021, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/global-environmental-indicators

Ruchi Bhatia collected this data because of the importance of environmental indicators for monitoring the state of our environment. Tracking and making environmental indicators accessible helps push others to take responsibility for the space we all share. They also serve as warning signs for downturns in the state of our environment, and can help decisions be made before undesirable effects occur. This data was collected from the United Nations which is a primary source. While it is not known how Ruchi Bhatia funded this data collection, the UN is funded by its member states and voluntary contributions.

### **Findings:**

In answering the research question, for the given industry sectors what is the country-wide distribution of overall ESG scores, based on the stacked bar chart visualization, the United States had the highest ESG distribution across a large majority, 57 of 70, total industry sectors. Thus, accounting for 81% of the country-wide majority distribution in contrast to other countries. For instance, if we took a look at the industry sector ‘Telecommunication Services’ just the country’s sub sectors combined totals average ESG scores are about upwards of 580 in ESG score while the other 73 countries observed within this sector have observed ESG scores of roughly below 100. As seen in other diverse sectors such as ‘Oil & Gas Exploration & Production’, ‘Healthcare Equipment & Supplies’ and ‘Banks’ the same trend persists. Based on these trends, we can conclude that certainly a lot of companies and their respective industries have high ESG scores on average in the United States especially in fields of healthcare and engineering. Though we can attest to lower ESG scores in other countries around the world in relation to missing data in the country column for certain industry sectors or sub sectors or data bias which prompted our French dataset owner to highlight more data from Western countries in his dataset in contrast to other non-Eurocentric countries. However, it is simply also the underlying notion that the resources in other developing countries are not as developed as a first-world country like the United States which continues to produce higher average ESG score rates and highlights the nation’s progress in adhering to sustainable practices. 

For regions that are still within developing areas, their renewable energy shares are completely tarnished in comparison to their already developed counterparts. Take India for example, as one of the most well known developing countries due to various reasons (lower GDP per capita, corruption, and growth in population) their renewable energy share from their total consumption of energy pales in comparison to a more developed country like Singapore. As seen in my chart, India becomes less sustainable; starting at roughly 45% of renewables shares in 2002, and having a large decrease to 32.5% within just 8 years. In comparison to Singapore, who in 2002 had 50% shares of renewable energy with an exponential growth seen in 2019, when their energy share became 80% renewable! They simply do not have the same resources as Singapore in order to become more sustainable, as other things may be prioritized in the stead of other variables; from this it may be beneficial to examine these external factors more thoroughly.

Based on our scatter plot, China has the highest recorded total emissions at 10,274,851, and a per capita amount of 7.34. If we look at the US, it has total emissions of 5,424,881 but emissions per capita of 16.58. This per capita amount is twice that of China's yet they produce a little over half of China's total emissions. If we look at India, which is the second most populous country in the world, it places 4th for total emissions. Yet, India has emissions per capita of 1.28. Based on these trends, we can see that total emissions is not the best representative of emissions productions. Countries with lower populations  (like the US) produce higher emissions per person relative to a country like China or India that are two of the most populated countries in the world. On the other hand, we found that relatively small but more developed countries had higher emissions per capita. Qatar for example, had the highest amount of emissions per capita, with a population of under 3 million.While it’s important to consider both total emissions and emissions per capita, when comparing countries and measuring their environmental impact, it may be more relevant to compare measures per capita. 

### **Discussion**

The importance of our findings highlight that though the purpose of the chart was to compare countries around the world in relation to their overall or average environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores across a diverse set of sub sector industries within the broader scope of industry sectors, we found it to be of keen interest to explore how these scores vary based on industry domain where more energy and sustainability focused industries produce on average, higher ESG score outcomes but more specifically how this trend would translate in terms of a country based spread. After exploring multiple industries in the dataset, the observation that a high majority of ESG scores were in the United States in contrast to other countries from the other side of the world was most notable. More Eurocentric countries after the United States were followed by Great Britain and Japan and some parts included Australia and Brazil in this order. Though the list may appear diverse the disparity between ESG scores and industries of companies within this dataset that were from other countries besides the US was limited which brought about this clear variance which is indicative of Western countries’ standards being the model the rest of the world is shaped to adapt or take inspiration from. The ESG scoring and rating scale was in fact devised by an American, Paul Clements-Hunt which may have influenced available data for the matter which the rest of the world does not necessarily meet the criteria or standard for. Thus, it is interesting how though it may seem that the United States has the highest ESG scores across a vast majority of industries, the data disparity and lack of equal numbers of companies within each sector for other nations and a biased standard scale may have skewed the results. 

The importance of our findings indicate that there is a much larger problem on hand. Seeing the renewability shares out of a country’s total energy consumption is only the tip of the iceberg. Through taking a closer look into countries that are becoming more/less renewable as time goes on, we can start to see what regions are posing these positive or negative trends. Once we are able to find the general area of issue, we are able to find what factors are inhibiting said countries from being more renewable or whether the current political climate is not letting them do so. More developed countries tend to skew towards being very renewable or utilizing non-renewable energy; whereas smaller countries tend to use more renewable sources. It is also interesting to note that countries within the Eastern Asian region have become more focused on renewability within the last two decades, in comparison to the South/Western Asian region (where they seemed to have declined in that aspect.

The importance of our findings from the scatter plot demonstrate that there are some big players that are most responsible for their harmful impact on the environment. Countries that have both extremely high emissions paired with high emissions per capita, as well as countries with high emissions per capita relative to others, participate in destructive practices that contribute to high emissions and other environmental issues. By identifying these countries, global leaders can work together to enforce more sustainable initiatives on a worldwide scale. As all of the countries with data displayed in the scatter plot are members of the United Nations, the UN can hold member countries more accountable for their environmental impacts. It is important that countries begin to shift their focus towards more renewable energy sources and sustainable development at both a governmental and corporate level. 

### **Conclusion**
Let’s start with perspective. First and foremost, there needs to be a level of ‘grace’ that is taken when viewing these results, as we are looking at a very small window into a much larger picture. Although it may be easy to point the finger at more developing countries for not doing their fair share in terms of renewable consumption, there are many factors that may prohibit them from doing so. Economically, they are at a distinct disadvantage, and are not granted the resources that developed countries have on hand. And so socio-economic and political factors of a region must be taken into account when interpreting renewable energy results, especially that in developing countries. 

Much of the information provided within our data sets are central to the United States, and when taking a closer look at the seventy industry sectors that are presented, there is one key finding, the United States consistently is shown to have industry sectors with the highest ESG scores and accordingly the highest ESG ratings as well. While this may be something to celebrate initially, this distribution by ESG scores is not emphasized on a global level. There is clear bias to be found, favoring the Eurocentric perspective, and though this can be useful for us as Americans, it limits our vision to a singular perspective all the while discounting other regions’ industry breakdown by score . Therefore, this observation cannot be viewed as a blanket statement towards other countries’ ESG scores nor discredit the value of their individual score standings as indicative of their own means of achieving sustainability development efforts.

Many developed countries produce more emissions relative to the size of the country than less developed countries, despite having the technology and resources to decrease emissions and turn to more sustainable solutions. Corporations and governments play a huge role in how the environment is impacted. All in all, stricter regulations and a shift towards more sustainable forms of renewability is needed in order to create said change. We as a group are asking the audience to take this into consideration as it cannot only be the citizens who are advocating for change, but there needs to be advocacy seen within government leadership and in Fortune 500 companies. Governments have the power to hold corporations based in their country accountable for their environmental footprint and should consider how these corporations may affect the futures of their citizens and country.
